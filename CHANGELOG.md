# Changelog

All notable changes to `matten` are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project aims to
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) once it reaches
a public API (`0.1.0`).

## [0.0.1] - 2026-06-20

The **M0 crate skeleton**: a compiling, lint-clean, CI-ready foundation aligned
with the v2 reconciled specification. No math is implemented yet.

### Added

- Crate manifest with the locked feature matrix
  (`default = ["serde", "json", "csv"]`), edition 2024, and MSRV `1.85`.
- `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` crate-wide.
- Stable public error surface: the canonical `MattenError` enum (derives only
  `Debug`; matched by variant, never `==`) and the public `DataFormat` enum, with
  manual `Display` and `std::error::Error` implementations.
- Minimal public `Tensor`: `new`, `try_new`, `shape`, `ndim`, `len`, `as_slice`,
  and a shape-first `Debug`. Construction uses checked shape-product arithmetic.
- `examples/hello_tensor.rs` smoke example; unit and integration smoke tests.
- CI (fmt, clippy `-D warnings`, tests, doctests, feature-profile builds, MSRV).
- mdBook documentation scaffold under `docs/`.

### Notes

- `is_empty()` is intentionally absent (deferred to a future zero-sized-tensor RFC).
- The full Core Tensor Contract (scalar/vector/matrix predicates, `to_vec`,
  reshape, transpose, arithmetic, broadcasting, slicing, JSON/CSV) lands in M1
  and later milestones.
